**Calculator 1.0** has very basic features such as addition, subtraction and multiplication we have plans to add many other different useful features to the calculator

### Download

You can download the calculator by going to the release tab on this repository and clicking **Source code (zip)** after doing so you must have Java 8 installed on your computer then run it in Eclipse or Intellij

### API Support

We are currently working on a API for this calculator when more advanced features come to the calculator

```java
CalculatorAPI.solve(method, problem);
CalculatorAPI.graph(point, point, axis, axis);
Problem problem = CalculatorAPI.createProblem(problem);
Graph graph = CalculatorAPI.createGraph(type);
Mode mode = CalculatorAPI.indentMode(name, id);
```

### Future of Project

We are planning to make the program runnable in a executable file and have a sleak design to it with multiple different modes such as ```Area Calculator, Triangle Calculator, Graphing Calculator``` these modes will be released over periods of times as we want high quality and working updates
